# cod-colorizer
Colored text generator for Call of Duty + United Offensive. (CoD1, CoD:UO)

I'm not sure if anyone could need this for a 20 year old game, but hey... it still might be useful for generating colored names, binds or server messages.

You can use it online [HERE](https://spacegears.github.io/cod-colorizer).
