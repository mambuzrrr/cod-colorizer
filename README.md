# cod-colorizer
Colored text generator for the classic Call of Duty titles. (CoD1, CoD:UO, CoD2, CoD4)

I'm not sure if anyone would need this for 15+ year old games, but hey... it still might be useful for generating colored names, binds or server messages.

You can use it online [HERE](https://spacegears.github.io/cod-colorizer).
